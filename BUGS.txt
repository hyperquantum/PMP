CRASHES

 - GUI remote: dragging the second last entry in the queue and dropping it beyond the last entry crashes the client


INCORRECT BEHAVIOUR

 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (probably because no player status message was sent during queue population)


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

  - Indexation at server startup can cause the machine to become very slow
  - Database access for track repetition avoidance needs to be optimized and data needs to be cached
