* add GUI for entering Last.fm user credentials
* don't store Last.FM session key in plain text in the database
* handle timeouts
* handle failed requests properly (OpenSSL missing or connection problem)
* make sure OpenSSL libraries are included in binary releases
* the scrobbling machinery currently has to wait for the first full indexation to finish, fix this



When merging the branch:

* delete "scrobbling" protocol extension and put its content into the main network protocol
* change User Agent version for our Last.fm scrobbling back end
