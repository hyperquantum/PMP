* bug: "now playing" is triggered by the backoff mechanism after the track is already finished
* handle timeouts
* handle failed requests properly (OpenSSL missing or connection problem)
* make sure OpenSSL libraries are included in binary releases
* the scrobbling machinery currently has to wait for the first full indexation to finish, fix this
* race condition after track finished playing, between history insert and check for something to scrobble



When merging the branch:

* delete "scrobbling" protocol extension and put its content into the main network protocol
* reorder enum members for scrobbling protocol
* change User Agent version for our Last.fm scrobbling back end
