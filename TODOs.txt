BUGS

 - some tracks do not play on Windows; presumably because they have an ID3 tag with version 2.4
 - for some tracks we get the wrong length (caused by length estimation in TagLib)
 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (only a player status message from the server will trigger an update now)
 - diagnostic logging produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log
 - when on GStreamer: InvalidMedia error "Your GStreamer installation is missing a plug-in" freezes playback
 - music collection list sorting does not ignore spaces between words
 - the commandline client does not support user authentication which is now required for some commands it supports
 - after probing a server the client outputs "QIODevice::read: device not open"


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

 - database access for track repetition avoidance needs to be optimized and data needs to be cached


TECHNICAL TODO

 - keep track lengths in milliseconds, not seconds
 - we need a track preload mechanism; especially important for tracks on an external medium
 - associate a title and artist with each hash and save that information in the database (?)
 - when running an indexation, analyze the most recently created/updated files first


IDEAS

 - 'like' button for the song that is playing, that will bump the score of the song a little bit
 - 'love' & 'hate' button for the song that is playing
 - statistics view for the user; with things like "amount of tracks played in the last 7/30/... days"
 - 'about the remote' window; with client version and protocol version
 - 'about the server' window; with server name, UUID and protocol version


USER FRIENDLINESS

 - provide 'forgot password' functionality to enable a user to reset their password
 - support for dragging tracks from the music collection into the queue
 - work around the need for a full indexation at server startup
 - when creating a new account, explain the meaning of the password score
 - GUI remote: after login it should show what server it is connected to somehow


POLISHING

 - when skipping the current track after a long-time pause (say, more than 10 min), do not let the skip affect scoring of the paused track
