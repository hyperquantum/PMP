BUGS

 - GUI remote: dragging the second last entry in the queue and dropping it beyond the last entry crashes the client
 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (only a player status message from the server will trigger an update now)
 - diagnostic logging now produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

 - database access for track repetition avoidance needs to be optimized and data needs to be cached


FEATURES

 - work around the need for a full indexation at server startup
 - associate a title and artist with each hash and save that information in the database
 - provide 'forgot password' functionality to enable a user to reset their password


USER FRIENDLINESS

 - a breakpoint in the queue should not put the next track in the player yet
