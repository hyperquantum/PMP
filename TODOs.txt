BUGS

 - GUI remote: dragging the second last entry in the queue and dropping it beyond the last entry crashes the client
 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (probably because no player status message was sent during queue population)
 - diagnostic logging now produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

 - Database access for track repetition avoidance needs to be optimized and data needs to be cached


FEATURES

 - GUI remote needs status bar, to show current server activity (e.g. indexation)
 - work around the need for a full indexation at server startup
 - associate a title and artist with each hash and save that information in the database
