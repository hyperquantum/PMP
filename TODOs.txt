BUGS

 - for some tracks we get the wrong length (caused by length estimation in TagLib)
 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (only a player status message from the server will trigger an update now)
 - diagnostic logging produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log
 - when on GStreamer: InvalidMedia error "Your GStreamer installation is missing a plug-in" freezes playback
 - track info for a queue entry is requested 3 times for each track
 - Generator might get into infinite loop if source list does not contain any suitable candidates (?)
 - music collection list sorting does not ignore spaces between words
 - most server commands should be unavailable to a client before it has done a successful login procedure


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

 - database access for track repetition avoidance needs to be optimized and data needs to be cached


FEATURES

 - add support for dragging tracks from the music collection into the queue
 - work around the need for a full indexation at server startup
 - associate a title and artist with each hash and save that information in the database
 - provide 'forgot password' functionality to enable a user to reset their password


USER FRIENDLINESS

 - when creating a new account, explain the meaning of the password score
 - GUI remote: after login it should show what server it is connected to somehow


POLISHING

 - when skipping the current track after a long-time pause (say, more than 10 min), do not let the skip affect scoring of the paused track
 - better display of a breakpoint in the queue
