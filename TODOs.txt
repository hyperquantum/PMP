BUGS

 - for some tracks we get the wrong length (caused by length estimation in TagLib)
 - diagnostic logging produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log
 - when on GStreamer: InvalidMedia error "Your GStreamer installation is missing a plug-in" freezes playback
 - the commandline client does not support user authentication which is now required for some commands it supports
 - GUI remote: tracks can be dragged using the right mouse button (not just the left button)
 - GUI remote: tracks without title/artist info are listed as a blank line in the music collection table
 - GUI remote: after a breakpoint is hit, track length and play position are not cleared


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

 -


TECHNICAL TODO

 - keep track lengths in milliseconds, not seconds
 - associate a title and artist with each hash and save that information in the database (?)
 - when running an indexation, analyze the most recently created/updated files first
 - large file support (?)


IDEAS

 - 'like' button for the song that is playing, that will bump the score of the song a little bit
 - 'love' & 'hate' button for the song that is playing
 - statistics view for the user; with things like "amount of tracks played in the last 7/30/... days"
 - 'about the remote' window; with client version and protocol version
 - 'about the server' window; with server name, UUID and protocol version
 - ability to put playback volume adjustments in the queue (the same way as breakpoints)
 - show recent play history in the client (e.g. last 3 songs)
 - ability to view statistics such as 'previously heard' and 'score' for the song currently playing
 - visual indication of score for each track in the music collection, to make 'good' tracks stand out
 - add other statistics relevant for scoring (e.g. was the track manually added to the queue) to the play history
 - provide play/pause buttons in Windows taskbar popup
 - use libgroove for playback (?)
 - support tagging tracks for classification (like GMail uses labels for e-mail) and meta-info


USER FRIENDLINESS

 - provide 'forgot password' functionality to enable a user to reset their password
 - work around the need for a full indexation at server startup
 - when creating a new account, explain the meaning of the password score
 - GUI remote: after login it should show what server it is connected to somehow
 - inform the user properly when the server is having problems connecting to the database
 - display the title/artist of the track currently playing in the window title of the remote
 - the drop indicator in the queue needs to be drawn as a line between tracks


POLISHING

 - when skipping the current track after a long-time pause (say, more than 10 min), do not let the skip affect scoring of the paused track
 - an icon for the GUI remote executable
 - be more strict in determining the 'end time' for the history of a track that was played; time when paused should not count
