 - for some tracks we get the wrong length (caused by length estimation in TagLib)
 - GUI remote: dragging the second last entry in the queue and dropping it beyond the last entry crashes the client
 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (only a player status message from the server will trigger an update now)
 - diagnostic logging now produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log

 - provide 'forgot password' functionality to enable a user to reset their password


USER FRIENDLINESS
