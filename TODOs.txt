BUGS

 - for some tracks we get the wrong length (caused by length estimation in TagLib)
 - GUI remote: queue length not updated after initial queue population (only a player status message from the server will trigger an update now)
 - diagnostic logging now produces unreadable text when two different threads write something to the log
 - when on GStreamer: InvalidMedia error "Your GStreamer installation is missing a plug-in" freezes playback
 - "Expand" action generates less than 5 new tracks because of multiple candidate rejections (lastHeard too recent)


PERFORMANCE ISSUES

 - database access for track repetition avoidance needs to be optimized and data needs to be cached


FEATURES

 - use a shuffled pool of tracks as source for the random track generator, and draw from it until it's empty
 - work around the need for a full indexation at server startup
 - associate a title and artist with each hash and save that information in the database
 - provide 'forgot password' functionality to enable a user to reset their password


USER FRIENDLINESS

 - when creating a new account, explain the meaning of the password score
 - GUI remote: after login it should show what server it is connected to somehow
